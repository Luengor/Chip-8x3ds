# Chip-8x3ds
Implementing a [chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator on the 3ds.  
I'm using [devkitPro](https://github.com/devkitPro) to develop and compile code for the 3ds.


## How to run:
Just build the code with `make` and put `chip8.3dsx` on the 3ds sd-card. It
should run a `chip8-rom.ch8` in the same directory as `chip8.3dsx`.
